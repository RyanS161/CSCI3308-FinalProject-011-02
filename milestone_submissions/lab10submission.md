### 5) Application Description

Tuple Trivia will be a website where users can make an account and solve trivia questions under time constraints.

The user begins by logging into or registering for Tuple Trivia, and then they will be greeted with a page that displays trivia categories. After choosing a category, the user must choose a difficulty. Then the user will solve multiple trivia questions under a time constraint. After they finish the challenge, they will receive a score, and it will be posted to the Tuple Trivia leaderboard.

This application will give users the ability to have fun with friends in a competitive and intellectual environment. Users can choose to play by themselves or play with friends collaboratively.
